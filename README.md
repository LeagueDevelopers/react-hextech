This library is targeting the web first. As such, it is important that all your work is responsive, does not sacrifice accessibility (screen reading and tab/arrow key navigation) and uses normal `<input>` elements when possible.

Another objective is to not use any of Riot's art assets directly, instead re-creating them using CSS and SVG (you may see some of these lying around in the repo, v1.0.0 won't until they're gone).
